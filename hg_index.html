            <h2 style=color:blue>Welcome to Harpe Gaming. We have a simple philosophy. It has three main points:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><em>Unplug</em></li>
                    <li><em>Interact</em></li>
                    <li><em>Reconnect</em></li>
                </ol>

            <h3 style=color:blue>    
                And that's it. We believe that the best games are the ones 
                that bring people together through shared experiences.
            </h3> 
            <p>
                With all due respect to our video gamer friends, you can't always get
                that from a computer screen. Sometimes you need the 
                intimate approach of sitting face-to-face around 
                a common table with the soda and chips at your elbow.

            We are a local board and card game store located in the 
            heart of Morgantown near the campus. We carry 
            hundreds of games and puzzles, including:
            <ul>
                <li>educational games</li> 
                <li>family games</li>
                <li>card games</li> 
                <li>historical simulations</li> 
                <li>role-playing games</li>   
            </ul> 
                <em>...and so much more.</em> 
            If you remember a great game from your youth, we 
            probably have it in our antiques collection. If we don't, we know where we can get it.

            <h3 style=color:blue>We're more than just a place to buy games.</h3> 
            We celebrate gaming and the company of good friends. 
            Our game room is free for all to us. Sit down, pick out 
            a game from our demo library and start playing. 
            We sponsor tournaments, challenges, and special 
            social events. You'll always find a game to play.
            
            We're always on the lookout for the best new games. We 
            publish periodic reviews of new titles. Just out 
            our reviews of <a href="hg_towers.html">Towers and Temples</a> and <a href="hg_alliance.html">
            Alliance</a>; both new this month at Harpe Gaming.
